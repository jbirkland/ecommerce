# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description
In this project I modified starter code which was a mock up to a backend e-commerce website. The company wants a website that uses the latest technologies and provides them with a database to store and track there items. In this project the concept was to learn about the MVC model to create a database, link the tables by association and provide code to create a functional program through api routes using express and sequelize. Information was seeded to Workbench and all 
CRUD methods were tested in Insomnia.
